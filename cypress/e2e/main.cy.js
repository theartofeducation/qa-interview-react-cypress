/**
 * Cypress Testing Suite for the Artist Details Page
 * =================================================
 * 
 * Candidate Instructions:
 * - Your task is to implement the test cases outlined in this suite.
 * - Focus on writing robust assertions to validate the application's behavior and UI elements.
 * - Use Cypress commands and best practices to interact with the application.
 * - Refer to Cypress documentation for guidance: https://docs.cypress.io/api/table-of-contents
 * 
 * The tests should cover the following:
 * 1. Rendering of the application without crashing.
 * 2. Presence of initial UI elements.
 * 3. Loading and displaying artist details.
 * 4. Interaction with UI elements like buttons and list items.
 * 5. Management and preservation of UI state across different actions.
 * 
 * Ensure your tests are clear, maintainable, and effectively validate the expected functionalities.
